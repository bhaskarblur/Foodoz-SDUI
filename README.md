## Working of SDUI
1. All the key widgets like text, button, LazyColumn, LazyRow, Scaffold etc will be developed in Android app.
2. The backend will be responsible for controlling the layout and events of the UI, this will be done via JSON, that will include a proper structure of UI with widget types etc.
3. The Android app will consume this API and then render the UI accordingly.
4. We also have to write the functionality like button click in Android app only so that we can call these functions logically on events.
5. And all Set :))
